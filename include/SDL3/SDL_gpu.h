/*
 * A NOTE ON CYCLING
 *
 * When using a command buffer, operations do not occur immediately -
 * they occur some time after the command buffer is submitted.
 *
 * When a resource is used in a pending or active command buffer, it is considered to be "bound".
 * When a resource is no longer used in any pending or active command buffers, it is considered to be "unbound".
 *
 * If data resources are bound, it is unspecified when that data will be unbound
 * unless you acquire a fence when submitting the command buffer and wait on it.
 * However, this doesn't mean you need to track resource usage manually.
 *
 * All of the functions and structs that involve writing to a resource have a "cycle" bool.
 * GpuTransferBuffer, GpuBuffer, and GpuTexture all effectively function as ring buffers on internal resources.
 * When cycle is SDL_TRUE, if the resource is bound, the cycle rotates to the next unbound internal resource,
 * or if none are available, a new one is created.
 * This means you don't have to worry about complex state tracking and synchronization as long as cycling is correctly employed.
 *
 * For example: you can call MapTransferBuffer, write texture data, UnmapTransferBuffer, and then UploadToTexture.
 * The next time you write texture data to the transfer buffer, if you set the cycle param to SDL_TRUE, you don't have
 * to worry about overwriting any data that is not yet uploaded.
 *
 * Another example: If you are using a texture in a render pass every frame, this can cause a data dependency between frames.
 * If you set cycle to SDL_TRUE in the ColorAttachmentInfo struct, you can prevent this data dependency.
 *
 * Cycling will never undefine already bound data.
 * When cycling, all data in the resource is considered to be undefined for subsequent commands until that data is written again.
 * You must take care not to read undefined data.
 *
